Deployment from a Time Perspective

Some crude time estimates, clearly show that
the overwhelming majority of time is spent inside
the rendering process. 

still, its good to be aware of some other possible,
places of linear time growth. the content filtering
section . Note this is unlike the mime mapping section 
which also uses filters, but uses a short circuit alg.

a large amount of time is spent in the resolver,
switching to attributes instead of functions might
help access speed here.

 - unit tests
 	- Export Module
 	- URL Resolver
 	- analyze output flow for correctness

 - rename modules, setup aliases for compatiblity
 - get rid of any bad vhm hacks
 - before doing url resolution strip out pre block contents
 
 User Interface cleanups

  - General remove the tab links back to the container.
  
  - mastering ui (content rules) see if another organization
    can make more sense. 
    
  - more descriptive docs in the UI

 Identification
 - use generators in content identification

 Targets
 - make deployment targets interface based

 Sources
 - make content source interface based
   possibly allow for setting args on the catalog source
 - allow for multiple sources

 Mastering
 - renamine mime mapping to content/deployment rule

Bugs and Feature Requests

  - editing the view path create a new entry in the Content Directory Views
	
  - need a way to delete a directory path from the Content Directory Views
	
  - create exporting policy to XML	
  - separate deployment skin

  - think about use cases for multihomed content, and implementation of 
    identification of multihomecontent. ie say a content piece with
    a script url that uses subpath traverse.
	
Sample Deployment Policy Test Run
    - fixed issue with policy loading properly (new?)
    - in doing the deployment and loading it up on a webserver two problems
      were noticed. 
    - first several forms point to the origin server, these need to be fixed
      via a separate deployment skin.
      
    - second the css import urls are also pointing back to the origin server,
      the uri resolver needs to be fixed.  (I noticed this in a couple areas)
      
      #### this is now fixed
      
      form urls as well cause problems for the resolver.
      
      ### leaving this unfixed for now the use cases for deploying dynamic actions
      ### in static deployment aren't clear.
      
    - deployment link errors


Deployment Link errors found
  - portal root ( from contacts)
  - in metadata if you are at the root the link for up is "#" and is giving an error
    probably should ignore any link that start with "#"  Do we need to translate
    anchors?
  - [FIXED] resolver should ignore any href with javascript: as the protocol
  - fix issue with linking to a folder directly
  - items in Navigation portlet get a link error

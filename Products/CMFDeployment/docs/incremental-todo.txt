Things that need doing to make incremental deployment happen.

 dependencies.py

   dependency manager.

   dependency content source and installation with policy pipe association.

 incremental.py

   incremental plugin index 
     
   content deletion source

 lots of places

  - multiple types of descriptor abstractions ( currently only for publication,
    also need deletion ).

 segments.py
  - cleaning up and adding abstractions to segments or swapping in 
    taskengine, things like split, iterator, join, etc.
  
  content pipeline filtering segment for ignoring duplicates.

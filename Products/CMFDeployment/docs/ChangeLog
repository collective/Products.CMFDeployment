	* ContentIdentification.py (1.15), ContentMastering.py (1.24),
	Strategies/Default.py (1.8): 
	trying some optimizations on memory

2003-01-08 23:29  kapil

	* Protocols/__init__.py (1.6): 
	
	import log from the right location

2003-01-08 23:21  kapil

	* Protocols/__init__.py (1.5): 
	
	- behave nicely if rsync protocol import fails...

2003-01-08 20:33  kapil

	* ContentMastering.py (1.23), Descriptor.py (1.11), URIResolver.py
	(1.21), __init__.py (1.8), Strategies/Default.py (1.7): 
	nothing of substance, backed out of some changes which never made
	it to cvs, committing to sync files.

2003-01-07 06:31  kapil

	* ContentOrganization.py (1.12): 
	 - nested scope fix for py2.1
	 - accessor for compound doc types

2003-01-05 03:40  kapil

	* ChangeLog (1.7): updated

2003-01-05 03:32  kapil

	* ChangeLog (1.6), ContentDeployment.py (1.11), ContentStorage.py
	(1.9), ContentURI.py (1.11), DefaultConfiguration.py (1.10),
	DeploymentExceptions.py (1.4), DeploymentInterfaces.py (1.5),

	utils.py (1.5), Extensions/Install.py (1.4), Protocols/RsyncSSH.py
	(1.4), Protocols/__init__.py (1.4), Strategies/Default.py (1.6),
	Strategies/__init__.py (1.3), docs/ConfigurationGuide.txt (1.2): 

	- changed contact email address, old one is going away next week

2003-01-05 03:31  kapil

	* PolicyReader.py (1.13): 
	
	 - some changes to support a distributed plone policy file, we
	can't specify
	   exact directory names on unknown systems, so we introduce syntax
	to allow
	   for dir spec. relative to the cmf deployment installation.

2003-01-05 03:30  kapil

	* ContentIdentification.py (1.14): 
	 - integrated directly restricted id filtering
	
	 - cleanedup logging statements (renabled, and using getPath, and
	portal_type)

2003-01-05 03:27  kapil

	* ContentMastering.py (1.22): 
	 - log when no mime mapping found for a content object
	
	 - removed unused site root chaining code

2003-01-05 03:25  kapil

	* DeploymentHistory.py (1.7): 
	
	 - store history ids as strings, not integers. integers seem to
	cause problems
	   with zpublisher, even though the proper object is returned via
	bobo_traverse

2003-01-05 03:23  kapil

	* DeploymentTool.py (1.6): 
	
	 - redirect to policy's manage workspace, not manage main

2003-01-05 03:23  kapil

	* ContentDirectoryViews.py (1.9): 
	
	 - catch errors from skin resources which raise errors while
	cooking, log em,
	   and make the descriptor a ghost.

2003-01-05 03:20  kapil

	* URIResolver.py (1.20), testResolver.py (1.3): 
	 - new url replacement strategy, to fix some resolution bugs
	   when shorter urls would actually replace text of longer ones.
	
	   the new scheme, uses the exact text of the original link for
	   replacement, and does the url replacement inline of the link
	text,
	   before doing a source replacement. its 100% safe and accurate,
	   but a little slower (+%30 overhead over previous algorithm)
	
	 - fix and test for for relative url resolution bug

2003-01-05 03:16  kapil

	* FileStructure.py (1.8): 
	 - new filter foldered collector impl that does incremental
	   garbage collection along the way. this takes care of the
	   biggest memory spike when using the deployment tool :-)

2003-01-05 03:14  kapil

	* MimeMapping.py (1.3), ui/MimeExtensionMappingEditForm.dtml (1.3):
	
	
	 - added notes, cvs id to mimemapping
	 - added ttw editing for ghost flag

2003-01-05 03:11  kapil

	* examples/plone.xml (1.1): 
	 - start of an example policy for a default plone site. when
	finished this
	   should deploy a static copy of a plone site out of the box, to
	be installed
	   alongside the tool installation.

2003-01-05 03:10  kapil

	* DeploymentLogging.py (1.1), Log.py (1.7),
	ui/LoggingConfigurationForm.dtml (1.1): 
	 added support for component level logging options
	
	 - components can be configured individually to either
	   log to zlog, or be recorded by log monitors
	
	 - added ttw configuration for logging
	
	 - the ttw config is disabled currently, i ran into something nasty
	   so i'm holding off on it till post 1.0
	
	 - another note about logging config, its not really safe for
	   concurrent policy execution, as the last executed policy's
	config
	   will be used. i should set it up as a global config for the
	tool.

2003-01-05 03:04  kapil

	* ContentOrganization.py (1.11), ui/OrganizationCompositeForm.dtml
	(1.1), ui/OrganizationRestrictedForm.dtml (1.1): 
	
	- new support for Composite Content types, basically folderish
	objects which	don't want to be represented on the fs as folders.
	
	- exposed restricted ids for web configuration.

2003-01-02 22:46  kapil

	basis (need some additional testing of this.)

	* ui/: DeploymentHistoryOverview.dtml (1.2), HistoryView.dtml

	 - doesn't use content object at all anymore, only descriptor

2003-01-02 14:22  kapil

	* Descriptor.py (1.9): 
	added descriptor factory, pushed some additional burden onto the
	descriptor for content_url and is content folderish, for less round

	URIResolver.py (1.15): 
	
	sundry ugly hacks for sites without proper vhosting/proxy setups
	
	basically in such situations, absolute_url works fine but
	absolute_url(relative=1) is borked. which is a central aspect of
	the dtool.

	(1.2): massive commit, this gets us into good working order, for
	deployment.
	
	additionally its an initial landing point of the mass refactoring i
	started a few weeks ago at cs.
	
	the zmi screens still need work, as does component initiliazation,
	and reporting of stat collection.
	
	incremental deployment functionality, is tops on the todo list.
	
	doing multiple renderings per content type is going to require some
	sort additional refactoring.
	
	top priority on zmi is reducing its complexity, and getting it
	completely functional again, and integrating ordered folder, so
	that all the filterish things, can be explicitly ordered ttw.

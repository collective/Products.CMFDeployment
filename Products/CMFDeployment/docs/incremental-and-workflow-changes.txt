one of the tricky parts of doing incremental deployments, with the current architecture
of relying on catalog index for modification events, are workflow changes which only 
reindex on values specified as being workflow attributes of an object.

as a workaround for content whose deployment depends on workflow state, the incremental index 
can be added a a dummy workflow variable, which will ensure that the object is indeed
reindexed on workflow change in a manner visible to the deployment policy.

hopefully when a real event system lands that does modification notification the current
plugin index can be ripped out in favor of it.
